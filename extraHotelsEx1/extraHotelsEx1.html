<!--     Ex 1 | Hotels
Create three objects from a class Hotel. 
The Hotel class should have the following properties: 
hotelName, numberOfNights that will be a random integer from 1-10, 
address and image. It should also have a method showAvailability that will check the 
number of nights that the user is looking for and check against 
the number of nights in the hotel. 
If the hotel is available because the number of nights is 
bigger than the nights that the user is looking for, it will provide a button 
labeled "I'll reserve" otherwise it provides a message 
"Sorry, no available nights for <hotel name>. 

Be creative, design the page as you would want to. -->
